bockbuild is a light-weight build system that can both build and shape bundles
for GTK/Mono applications on OS X. Building is easily supported for both Linux
and Windows as well.

A build profile can be defined to build a complete jail of dependencies to
allow for locally running applications from source without affecting the
system libraries or other environment.

It was initially developed to build all of Banshee's dependencies and shape
them into a .app bundle.

solitary is the component that walks top-level components of an application
to collect all of their dependencies. It is technically a standalone component
that works against both native and managed code, resulting in a relocatable
application structure. Currently it only works for native code on OS X/darwin.
